# CoordinateCompare
Description:
Write a program that meets the following requirements: • Define a class named Point with two data fields x and y to represent a point’s x and y coordinates. Implement the Comparable interface for comparing the points on xcoordinates and on y-coordinates if x-coordinates are identical. • Define a class named CompareY that implements Comparator<Point>. • Implement the compare method to compare two points on their y-coordinates and on their x-coordinates (only if ycoordinates are identical.) • Randomly create 100 points, add them to an appropriate collections data structure and use an appropriate collections algorithm to display the points in increasing order of their x-coordinates and in increasing order of their y-coordinates, respectively.
